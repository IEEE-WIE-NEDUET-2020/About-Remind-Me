# REMIND ME 

Remind Me is an android app developed for university students to help them keep track of
the schedules of upcoming classes and other events like test, assignment and users can also make their own notes and reminders !!

Whenever a CR posts any assignment or test notice, a notfication is sent to all the students of that class and a reminder is scheduled to remind them a day before test or assignment!

## What Remind Me offers 

A Class will be created by a single representative from each class who then shares the class code (provided by the app ) with 
other mates to enter the class, after entering the class, students will have access to the posts made by their CR as follows:

### Alert
This is Alert about sudden cancels of classes, tests, assignment submission or any other. As soon the CR post the Alert, a notification will be sent to all students.

### Schedule: 
Class schedule is set here. We make sure the experience is as good as possible and user-friendly. It will schedule/update you all about the classes as set by the CR.

### Test: 
This will update related to the tests set by the CR and remind you a day before the test.

### Assignment:
It will remind you assignments set by the CR of your class

### My Notes: 
This is just for your personal notes. You want to remember any task you can add up and it will remind you.

 
The problem we approach by this application is managing the  on-site University schedules which is very tough and this  will be very helpful but unfortunately due to the Covid-19, most of us are having our classes online. Nevertheless, this app is a handy tool for CR to ease their duties, be it online or onsite classes !
