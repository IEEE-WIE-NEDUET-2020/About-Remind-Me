# REMIND ME 

Remind Me is an android app developed for university students to help them keep track of
the schedules of upcoming classes and other events like test, assignment and users can also make their own notes and reminders !!

Whenever a CR posts any assignment or test notice, a notfication is sent to all the students of that class and a reminder is scheduled to remind them a day before test or assignment!

The problem we approach by this application is managing the  on-site University schedules which is very tough and this  will be very helpful but unfortunately due to the Covid-19, most of us are having our classes online. Nevertheless, this app is a handy tool for CR to ease their duties, be it online or onsite classes !
